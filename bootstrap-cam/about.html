				<h3>What is the Kukui Cup?</h3>

				This October, 1000 first year students living on-campus at the
				University of Hawaii will take part in a three week challenge to
				learn about energy use in Hawaii and how to change their own energy
				behaviors and those around them for the better.

				<h3>Why is it important?</h3>

				One of the great challenges facing Hawaii today is our dependence on
				foreign oil, which negatively affects our security, our economy, our
				environment, and our next generation's ability to have a healthy,
				prosperous, sustainable lifestyle. The Kukui Cup raises awareness
				about Hawaii's oil dependency and how to create a better energy
				future. We hope the Kukui Cup will not only inspire energy conscious
				behaviors, but also the pursuit of energy-related studies at the
				University of Hawaii.

				<h3>How it works</h3>

				During the first three weeks of October, students living in the Hale
				Aloha residence halls can login to this website to gain access to
				information about their current power consumption and cumulative
				energy use. The site also provides short videos developed
				specifically for the competition that provide insight into Hawaii
				energy issues, and students earn points by correctly answering
				questions about each video's content. Students also earn points if
				their floor meets a daily energy conservation goal; by attending
				short, interactive "workshops" about energy held in the residence
				halls during the week; and by going on excursions to power plants,
				wind farms, and more. Students are eligible to win prizes including
				t-shirts, pizza parties, and gift certificates. By playing the game
				and competing to reduce energy, students become knowledgeable about
				the energy challenges facing Hawaii and how to change their own
				behavior and those around them to use energy more efficiently.

				<h3>Our technology</h3>

				The Kukui Cup uses technology developed by University of Hawaii
				Computer Science faculty and students that enables participants to:

				<ul>
					<li>see their current energy use in real time</li>
					<li>compete with others to reduce energy use</li>
					<li>sign up for one hour "workshops" on energy issues</li>
					<li>take part in excursions to power plants, wind farms, and
						more</li>
					<li>watch specially produced short videos about energy and
						Hawaii</li>
					<li>gain points for participation, and use these points to win
						prizes</li>
				</ul>

				The Kukui Cup application is fun, easy to use, accessible via the
				web or a smart phone, and integrated with email, Twitter, and
				Facebook.

				<h3>A "serious game"</h3>

				The Kukui Cup is part of a new generation of "serious" games. In
				serious games, players earn points, see their ranking on
				scoreboards, go on quests, and form communities just like
				traditional games. Unlike traditional games, the goal of a serious
				game is to make positive change in the real world, not conquer
				imaginary realms or other "virtual" outcomes. In the Kukui Cup,
				students use gaming techniques to learn about energy concepts,
				Hawaii's unique energy situation, challenges, and opportunities, and
				to change their behavior to contribute to a positive energy future
				for Hawaii.

				<h3>The pedagogy of tomorrow</h3>

				The Kukui Cup is educational, but it does not involve homework, it
				is not a class, and participation is voluntary. The Kukui Cup is
				designed to create effective learning experiences outside the
				traditional classroom setting. If successful, the Kukui Cup will
				define a new approach to energy education that can be adapted to a
				variety of settings.

				<h3>From student housing to offices to homes</h3>

				The 2011 Kukui Cup competition is just the first stage of a larger
				project. Our initial focus is University of Hawaii residence halls,
				and our goal is to institutionalize energy education for University
				of Hawaii first year students. We plan to adapt and enhance our
				approach to other environments in future years: office buildings,
				condominiums, and single family residential neighborhoods. Our long
				term goal is a palette of interactive technology for education and
				energy awareness that can reach and positively influence every
				citizen in Hawaii.

				<h3>A step toward HCEI</h3>

				The Hawaii Clean Energy Initiative has the ambitious goal of
				achieving 70% clean energy for Hawaii by the year 2030. This goal
				must be achieved through a combination of renewable energy
				generation and "efficiency". By educating Hawaii's citizens about
				the importance of energy and ways to change their behavior to reduce
				their energy footprint, the Kukui Cup project makes tangible,
				measurable progress toward the goals of the Hawaii Clean Energy
				Initiative.

				<h3>Research for the Smart Grid</h3>

				The Kukui Cup implements innovative technology for display of energy
				data from smart meters, and we will collect data to support the
				design of consumer-facing smart grid devices. The Kukui Cup project
				has produced open source software technologies including WattDepot
				for energy data collection, storage, and analysis, and Makahiki, a
				web application for applying game mechanics to energy feedback and
				education.
