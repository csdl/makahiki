Enhancement Ideas
=================

This chapter describes some enhancement projects for Makahiki that we believe would be
interesting and useful for the framework. 

Display online status for users
-------------------------------

It is not possible in Makahiki to know who is currently "on line" and playing the game.
Creating this awareness opens up new social gaming opportunities (performing tasks together), new
opportunities for communication (chat windows), and potentially entirely new games (play
"against" another online player).  

The goal of this enhancement is to extend the framework with a general purpose API that
provides the identities of those who are online, and then the development of one or more
user interface enhancements to exploit this capability. 

Deep Facebook integration
-------------------------

Makahiki currently supports a "shallow" form of Facebook integration: you can request that
your Facebook photo be used as your Makahiki profile picture, and you are given an
oppportunity to post to Facebook when the system notifies you of an accomplishment.

For this task, expand the current Facebook integration. One way is to deepen the
connection between user Facebook pages and their game play.  This might involve more automated
forms of notification (i.e. the same way Spotify playlists are posted to your Facebook
wall), or ways in which your activities on Facebook could impact on your Makahiki
challenge status (for example, posting a sustainability video to Facebook, or liking a
Sustainability organization could earn you points.)  

A different type of enhancement is to allow challenge designers to specify a Facebook page
as the official Challenge Facebook information portal, and have the system automatically
post information to that Facebook page as the challenge progresses.
