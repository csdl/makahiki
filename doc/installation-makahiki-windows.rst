Installation on Windows
=======================

Installation of Makahiki directly on windows is neither suggested nor supported.  Instead, we suggest the either creation of a virtual environment (either via `VirtualBox <https://www.virtualbox.org/>`_. or `vmware <http://www.vmware.com/>`_.), or :ref:`section-installation-makahiki-dualbooting` with Linux.
