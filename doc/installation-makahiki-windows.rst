Installation on Windows
=======================

We had installed Makahiki on the Windows environment sucessfully without
installing the memcached. It may be possible to develop Makahiki in a Windows environment, but due to the many problems we encountered during our limited experience of using Makahiki on Windows, we recommend to use a Unix platform such as Mac OS X and Linux for Makahiki development and deployment.

Besides install Makahiki "natively" on a windows environment, there are the two alternatives:
  * Use a Linux virtual machine
  * Dual boot to Linux

We also documented our experimental instructions on installing Makahiki directly on Windows.
