Local Virtual Machine Installation on Vagrant
=============================================

Vagrant is an application for managing virtual machines that enables the 
same configuration to be applied to more than one machine based on a 
Vagrantfile. This allows virtual machines used by different developers 
to have the same settings and environment configured on them automatically.

Vagrant can be installed on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows.

This virtual machine is for development. It should not be used as a production server.
