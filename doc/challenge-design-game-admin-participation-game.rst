Design the Participation Game
=============================

About the participation game
----------------------------

One of the current design constraints of the Kukui Cup is that the players associated with
each team in a challenge must be specified in advance of a challenge.  Thus, as the
challenge runs, it is possible to know exactly what percentage of each team's players are
*actively* playing the game (in the sense that they have logged in at least once).

The Participation Game is designed to incentivize active players on a team to recruit
other members of their team to login and try the game.  It does this by providing extra
points to all active players on a team when the percentage participation by that team
reaches certain thresholds (currently 50%, 75%, and 100%).

The current percentage participation by a player's team is shown in a scoreboard when this
game is enabled, and players receive an in-game notification whenever they reach a threshold 
participation where points are awarded.
