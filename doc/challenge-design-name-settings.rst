Clicking on `Challenge Settings` within the Challenge Design Page brings up a page with
sections allowing you to specify some global properties of your challenge.

Specify the name, logo, etc.

The first section of the page enables you to configure the basic identify of your challenge: its
name, logo, and so forth.

Makahiki uses the Name field and the Logo to brand the Challenge.  They appear on the
Left-hand side of the navigation bar of each page.  The domain is used to in the
Attendance and Bonus Codes to create the URL the player uses to collect their points. The
Team label is used in several widgets, such as energy scoreboard.  The Theme is the
default theme for the Challenge.
 
.. todo:: Document the challenge design name form. Specify where each of the values
   indicated in this form actually show up in the user interface. Location isn't used. 


Specify the Landing page text

The system is initialized with text appropriate to the Kukui Cup challenge at the
University of Hawaii.  You should change this to reflect your own challenge circumstances.

Specify the About page text
---------------------------

This form enables you to customize the text that appears on the About Page.

.. note:: Configuration of this section is **optional**, if you are satisfied with the
   default values.

.. todo:: The text field for displaying the About field should be made more than two lines
   deep (should be 20 lines minimum if possible). This is a programming change. To just change the
   about field is extremely difficult to do in a single admin form. We may need to have a separate
   form for the about field.


Specify the sponsors
--------------------

This form enables you to  specify the Sponsors that appear on the Landing page.

.. note:: Configuration of this section is **optional**, if you are satisfied with the
   default values.
