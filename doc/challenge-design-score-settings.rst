Design the point rubric 
=======================

After clicking on the "Score Settings" link in the Challenge Design page, a page similar to the following should appear:

.. figure:: figs/configuration/configuration-challenge-admin-score-settings.1.png
   :width: 600 px
   :align: center

All challenges must contain exactly one score settings object, which should be automatically created as part of the system initialization process.

This score settings object defines the "point rubric", i.e. the number of points to be
awarded for various types of actions in the game.   In most cases, the default rubric is
fine. 

Configure points
----------------

Clicking on the "Score Settings" instance takes you to a page where you can configure the number of points earned by players for various actions. 


.. note:: Remember to click the Save button at the bottom of the page when finished to save your changes.
