Manage the Smart Grid game
==========================

Approving Action submissions
----------------------------

You will need to approve or reject the action submitted from the players. Clicking on the "Action Submissions" link on the smartgrid game admin widget, a page similar to the following should appear:

   :align: center

By default, you will see all submitted actions with the "Pending approval" status. You can click on the link to see the submission details and do the approval there. Or, if the question and answer of the action is simple enough, you can select the action or several actions and use the "Action" dropdown "Approve the selected actions (USE CAUTION)" to approve the selected actions.

You can also go in to the "Change action member" page to look at the full question and answer of the submission, change the "Approval status" and provide the "Admin comment" back to the player.
