Environment Variables
=====================

The page provides a reference guide to the environment variables. 

.. note::  This environment variable documentation is extracted autogmatically from the
           settings.py file.  For this reason, the documentation shows the string
           "settings." on the front of each environment variable name.  The actual
           environment variable name is the uppercase string without the "settings." prefix.
