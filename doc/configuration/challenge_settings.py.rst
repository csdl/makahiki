Challenge Configuration
=======================

The configuration for a specific challenge is currently found in ``game_settings.py``. It is an organization-level configuration, including the name of the game, competition start/end date, authentication, etc.

.. note:: Should this be called "challenge_settings.py" to avoid ambiguity
          with games? This needs heavy editing for Makahiki2.  Also note that most of this stuff will be moved into the    
          admin interface, raising the possibility that we can eliminate this file altogether and/or merge page_settings.py into it.
