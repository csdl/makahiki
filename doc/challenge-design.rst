Challenge Design
================

Along with specifying authentication, wattdepot, and email configuration (see
:ref:`section-site-configuration`), you must also design the specific nature of your
challenge.  Go to the Settings Page (see :ref:`section-configuration-settings-page`), and
click on the Challenge Design button to retrieve the following page:

   :width: 600 px
   :align: center

As you can see, the page consists of two sections, "Challenge Settings" and "Game
Settings".  Challenge settings enables you to set the global properties of the challenge
(rounds, scores, users, etc.), while Game Settings enables you to configure the specific
games to appear in the challenge and their properties.
