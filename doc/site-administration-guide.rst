Site Administration Guide
=========================

This guide is divided into four sections, based upon the four fundamental phases in the
"life cycle" of a Makahiki serious game project:

  1. Software installation.  During this phase, you download and install the Makahiki
  software and related systems. 

  2. System configuration.  During this phase, you configure your Makahiki
  installation based upon your IT environment and your specific requirements for a
  challenge. 

  3. Challenge execution.  During this phase, the challenge is running and players
  are actually using your system. 

  4. Challenge post-mortem.  After the challenge is over, this phase concerns analysis of
  the data collected with the goal of better understanding what happened and how to
  improve your challenge design in the future.
