  Thanks for your interest in the Kukui Cup!
  <p/>
  The Kukui Cup is a National Science Foundation funded project whose goal is to 
  investigate how information technology can help create sustained, positive 
  changes in energy behaviors.   
  <p/>
  We want to engage first year students living in residence halls at the 
  University of Hawaii in a competition that helps them learn about energy's 
  production, consumption, impacts, and potential future in Hawaii.  
  We provide them with real-time feedback on their energy use, energy 
  conservation goals, a variety of competitions and interactive games, 
  and incentives such as prizes, food, t-shirts, entertainment, and bragging 
  rights.  
  <p/>
  We want the Kukui Cup to be a transformative experience for first year 
  students: providing them with a new way to connect and make friends with 
  other students in their residence halls, to have new opportunities for fun 
  and online interaction, to become more sophisticated in their knowledge of 
  and attitudes toward energy, and to reward at least some of them with prizes. 
  <p/>
  The 2011 competition is scheduled for October, 2011.  Once the competition 
  is underway, we will update this page with standings and other information 
  about the progress of the Kukui Cup.  Check back then for more details!
