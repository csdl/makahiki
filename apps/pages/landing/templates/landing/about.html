  <h3>What is the Kukui Cup?</h3>

  This October, 1000 first year students living on-campus at the University 
  of Hawaii will take part in a three week challenge to learn about energy 
  use in Hawaii and how to change their own energy behaviors and those 
  around them for the better.

  <h3>Why is it important?</h3>

  One of the great challenges facing Hawaii today is our dependence on 
  foreign oil, which negatively affects our security, our economy, our 
  environment, and our next generation's ability to have a healthy, 
  prosperous, sustainable lifestyle. The Kukui Cup raises awareness about 
  Hawaii's oil dependency and how to create a better energy future. We hope 
  the Kukui Cup will not only inspire energy conscious behaviors, but also 
  the pursuit of energy-related studies at the University of Hawaii.

  <h3>How it works</h3>

  During the first three weeks of October, students living in the Hale Aloha 
  residence halls can login to this website to gain access to information 
  about their current power consumption and cumulative energy use. The site 
  also provides short videos developed specifically for the competition that 
  provide insight into Hawaii energy issues, and students earn points by 
  correctly answering questions about each video's content.

  Students also earn points if their floor meets a daily energy conservation 
  goal; by attending short, interactive "workshops" about energy held in the 
  residence halls during the week; and by going on excursions to power 
  plants, wind farms, and more. Students are eligible to win prizes 
  including t-shirts, pizza parties, and gift certificates. By playing the 
  game and competing to reduce energy, students become knowledgeable about 
  the energy challenges facing Hawaii and how to change their own behavior 
  and those around them to use energy more efficiently.

  <h3>Our technology</h3>

  The Kukui Cup uses technology developed by University of Hawaii Computer 
  Science faculty and students that enables participants to:

  {# * see their current energy use in real time #}
  {#   * compete with others to reduce energy use #}
  {#   * sign up for one hour "workshops" on energy issues #}
  {#   * take part in excursions to power plants, wind farms, and more #}
  {#   * watch specially produced short videos about energy and Hawaii #}
  {#   * gain points for participation, and use these points to win prizes #}
  <ul>
    <li>see their current energy use in real time</li>
    <li>compete with others to reduce energy use</li>
    <li>sign up for one hour "workshops" on energy issues</li>
    <li>take part in excursions to power plants, wind farms, and more</li>
    <li>watch specially produced short videos about energy and Hawaii</li>
    <li>gain points for participation, and use these points to win prizes</li>
  </ul>

  {# (Editor's note: each of the above bullet points could be "decorated" with  #}
  {#   a screen image showing a portion of the web site.) #}

  The Kukui Cup application is fun, easy to use, accessible via the web or a 
  smart phone, and integrated with email, Twitter, and Facebook.

  <h3>A "serious game"</h3>

  The Kukui Cup is part of a new generation of "serious" games. In serious 
  games, players earn points, see their ranking on scoreboards, go on 
  quests, and form communities just like traditional games. Unlike 
  traditional games, the goal of a serious game is to make positive change 
  in the real world, not conquer imaginary realms or other "virtual" 
  outcomes.

  In the Kukui Cup, students use gaming techniques to learn about energy 
  concepts, Hawaii's unique energy situation, challenges, and opportunities, 
  and to change their behavior to contribute to a positive energy future for 
  Hawaii.

  <h3>The pedagogy of tomorrow</h3>

  The Kukui Cup is educational, but it does not involve homework, it is not 
  a class, and participation is voluntary. The Kukui Cup is designed to 
  create effective learning experiences outside the traditional classroom 
  setting. If successful, the Kukui Cup will define a new approach to 
  energy education that can be adapted to a variety of settings.

  <h3>From student housing to offices to homes</h3>

  The 2011 Kukui Cup competition is just the first stage of a larger 
  project. Our initial focus is University of Hawaii residence halls, and 
  our goal is to institutionalize energy education for University of Hawaii 
  first year students.

  We plan to adapt and enhance our approach to other environments in future 
  years: office buildings, condominiums, and single family residential 
  neighborhoods. Our long term goal is a palette of interactive technology 
  for education and energy awareness that can reach and positively influence 
  every citizen in Hawaii.

  <h3>A step toward HCEI</h3>

  The Hawaii Clean Energy Initiative has the ambitious goal of achieving 70% 
  clean energy for Hawaii by the year 2030. This goal must be achieved 
  through a combination of renewable energy generation and "efficiency". By 
  educating Hawaii's citizens about the importance of energy and ways to 
  change their behavior to reduce their energy footprint, the Kukui Cup 
  project makes tangible, measurable progress toward the goals of the Hawaii 
  Clean Energy Initiative.

  <h3>Research for the Smart Grid</h3>

  The Kukui Cup implements innovative technology for display of energy data 
  from smart meters, and we will collect data to support the design of 
  consumer-facing smart grid devices. The Kukui Cup project has produced 
  open source software technologies including WattDepot for energy data 
  collection, storage, and analysis, and Makahiki, a web application for 
  applying game mechanics to energy feedback and education.

  <h3>Our sponsors</h3>

  The Kukui Cup is grateful for financial support from: the National Science 
  Foundation under grant 1017126; the Center for Renewable Energy and Island 
  Sustainability; and the University of Hawaii Student Housing Services.
