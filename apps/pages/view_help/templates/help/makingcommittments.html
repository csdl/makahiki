			Some of the activities in the Smart Grid Game involve commitments, and you can engage in up to five 
			commitments at any one time.   We notice that you are committed to just "N" commitments.  Why not go 
			for all five and earn the super-committed badge for energy conservation? 

			To make a commitment, go to the Get Nutz page and find <5 - N> more commitments that you are comfortable 
			carrying out.   Remember that a commitment only lasts for five days and then have to renew it if you 
			want to continue the commitment.  You get points for each commitment you complete for a five day period.
