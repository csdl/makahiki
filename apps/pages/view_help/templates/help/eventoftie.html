			In the event that two or more individuals (or floors) are tied for the most points, 
			then the timestamp associated with the final goal, commitment, or activity associated 
			with the individuals (or floors) will be used to break the tie. In other words, the 
			individual (or floor) who got to their final point total first will be declared the 
			winner. Under the remote possibility that the final timestamps are equal, a coin toss 
			will be used to decide the winner.

			Given that energy consumption is measured down to a fraction of a watt-hour, we do not 
			anticipate that any floor could tie with respect to their consumption. In case that this 
			does occur, a coin toss will be used to decide the winner.
