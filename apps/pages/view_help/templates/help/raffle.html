			The Raffle Game provides a different way to win prizes, a way that does
			not require you to be the number 1 ranked lounge or person.  Each time
			you accumulate 25 Kukui Cup points, you receive 1 raffle ticket, which
			you can allocate into a drawing for one or more of the prizes in the
			raffle. Your chances of winning that prize correspond to the percentage
			of tickets allocated to that prize that you contributed.  You can change
			your ticket allocation at any time during a round.  The more points you
			earn, the more tickets you receive, and the higher your chances of
			winning prizes in the raffle.
