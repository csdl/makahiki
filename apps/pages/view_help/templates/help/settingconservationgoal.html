			One of the most challenging games in the Kukui Cup is the Daily Energy Goal.  We have collected data 
			on your lounge's energy usage since the beginning of the semester, and for this quest, you need to work 
			with your lounge mates to reduce your lounge's overall usage by 5%.  Each day that your lounge meets or 
			beats this conservation goal, you and everyone else in your lounge will earn Kukui Cup points.   

			To set a conservation goal, start by going to the Go Low page by clicking on the energy meter icon at the top of this 
			page.   Once there, find out your lounge's current consumption for today and see if it's above or below 
			the goal.   Then do whatever you can personally to minimize your energy consumption for the remainder of 
			today, and encourage your lounge mates to do the same. See the Go Low page for suggestions on what to do.

			If you're successful, your lounge will have used less energy than the goal by midnight 
			tonight, and everyone in your lounge will get awarded Kukui Cup points!
