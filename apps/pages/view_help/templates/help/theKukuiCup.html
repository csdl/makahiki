			The Kukui Cup residence hall energy competition is a blend of real world and virtual world 
			activities.   In the real world, participants attend events, engage in real-world activities like 
			geocaching, scavenger hunts, and artistic/musical events, win prizes, and most importantly, modify 
			their energy-related behaviors.  In the virtual world of the Kukui Cup web application, participants 
			earn points, achieve badges, increase their energy literacy through readings and videos, and use 
			social networking mechanisms to engage with friends about the event. Our hope is that this 
			combination of real and virtual activities complement and reinforce each other.  The blending of real 
			and virtual worlds has been explored in other "serious games" such as
