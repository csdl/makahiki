README.md for makahiki/install
===============================

This is a lower-level README for the Makahiki installation scripts.

The goal of this fork of Makahiki is to produce a set of 
Python scripts which further automate the process of installing 
Makahiki on Ubuntu Linux x86, Ubuntu Linux x64, and Redhat x64.

Makahiki is available at https://github.com/csdl/makahiki.

The install/ folder contains:
1. Linux scripts used for shell command testing. These are likely
   to be removed at an indeterminate, later date.
2. Python scripts which will eventually incorporate the 
   functionality of the shell scripts into a single 
   main script which manages other scripts.
