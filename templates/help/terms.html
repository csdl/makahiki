<h3>Motivation</h3>
One of the goals of the Kukui Cup is to learn more about the factors which help people to make sustained, positive changes to their energy behaviors.
<h3>Kinds of data collected</h3>

<ol>
<li> Data collected from your interactions with this website.  We will collect data about the things you do while logged in to this website, such as your activities, goals, and commitments.  This helps us to understand which of these tasks are interesting and helpful.
<li> Data gathered through interviews and questionnaires.  We will contact a subset of participants to request a short interview and/or to fill out an online questionnaire.  This data will help us to understand more about the strengths and weaknesses of our approach.
