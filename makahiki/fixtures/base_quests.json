Badges represent achievements reached during the game, both big and small.\r\n\r\nFor the most part, you'll have to discover the badges on your own, but we're going to give you a hint on this one. You will receive the Super Committed badge when you make 5 commitments (the maximum allowed by law). To complete this quest, you just need to get the badge by topping off your commitments to 5.\r\n\r\nYou know the drill by now: go to the Get Nutz page, click on a commitment square in the Smart Grid Game, and get your badge. *Note:* you may have to complete some other activities to get unlock all 5 commitments."
