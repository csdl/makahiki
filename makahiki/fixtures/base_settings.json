Participation can lead to prizes including\n\n        t-shirts, pizza parties, and gift certificates. By playing the game, students become\n\n        knowledgeable about the energy challenges facing Hawaii and how to change their own\n\n        behavior and those around them to use energy more efficiently.\n\n    </div>\n\n    <div><br>\n\n    </div>\n\n    <div>The following two minute video was used in 2011 to introduce students to the Kukui\n\n        Cup; it is one of the first things they watched after logging in to the website:\n\n    </div>\n\n    <div><br>\n\n    </div> \n\n    <div class=\"video-container video-wrapper2\">\n\n        <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" style=\"max-width: 500px;\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/T37kNTkZCrA\"\"\n\n                frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n    </div></br>\n\n    <h2>A \"serious game\"</h2>\n\n</div>\n\n<div>\n\nThe Kukui Cup is part of a new generation of \"serious\" games. In serious games, players earn\n\npoints, see their ranking on scoreboards, go on quests, and form communities just like\n\ntraditional games. Unlike traditional games, the goal of a serious game is to make positive\n\nchange in the real world, not conquer imaginary realms or other \"virtual\" outcomes. In the\n\nKukui Cup, students use \"gamification\" techniques to learn about energy concepts, Hawaii\'s\n\nunique energy situation, challenges, and opportunities, and to change their behavior to\n\ncontribute to a positive energy future for Hawaii.\n\n</div>\n\n<div><br>\n\n</div>\n\n<div>We presented a \"lightning talk\" at the 2011 Behavior, Energy, and Climate Change\n\n    conference on the use of gamification in the Kukui Cup and our preliminary results.\n\n    &nbsp;The following screencast provides a four minute version of that talk:\n\n</div>\n\n<div><br>\n\n</div> \n\n<div class=\"video-container video-wrapper2\">\n\n        <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" style=\"max-width: 500px;\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/XtIm9Nbi7PA\"\n\n                frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n</div></br>\n\n<h2>Makahiki: A game engine for energy</h2>\n\n\n\n<div>While the Kukui Cup content is specific to Hawaii\'s energy challenges and\n\n    opportunities, we have designed the system in two layers. Underneath the Kukui Cup\n\n    system is a \"game engine\" called Makahiki, which provides a customizable infrastructure\n\n    for development of energy challenges. &nbsp;</div>\n\n<div><br>\n\n</div>\n\n<div>We have exciting plans for improving the ability of Makahiki to support energy game\n\n    development. &nbsp;Please contact Philip Johnson (johnson@hawaii.edu) if you are\n\n    interested in more details.&nbsp;</div>\n\n<h2>Publications</h2>\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n    <ul>\n\n        <li>Robert S.
