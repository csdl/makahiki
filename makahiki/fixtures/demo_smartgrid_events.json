Then, you'll divide up into teams, and get exactly 30 minutes to go back to your tower and measure the power used by appliances. Prizes will be awarded to both the team that finds the appliance that uses the least amount of power as well as well as the team that finds the appliance that uses the most amount of power. \r\n\r\nNote: at least one member of each team needs a camera (cell phone camera OK) in order to take a picture of the appliance reading.

Hawaii, perhaps the closest thing we have to environmental perfection on earth, is regularly polluted by all the garbage washing up on our precious beaches.  \r\n\r\nDo your part to bring Oahu one step closer to utopia by attending this beach cleanup sponsored by [Surfrider Foundation](http://ww2.surfrider.org/oahu/).  Yes, you'll have to wake up early, but it's totally worth it: a free ride to the North Shore,  a couple of hours making Haleiwa Beach even more beautiful than it already is, then a free lunch and prizes provided by Spy Optics!\r\n\r\nMake sure you bring a hat, sunscreen, swim suit, and water (in a reusable water bottle, of course!) \r\n\r\nReserve your spot on the bus by clicking the **I want to sign up** button below. Spaces are limited. \r\n\r\nMeet in the Hale Aloha courtyard, from there we'll get on the bus.  Don't be late, this one leaves early.  Note that this excursion is worth the most points of all!   Good attendance by your lounge could just put you over the top!"
