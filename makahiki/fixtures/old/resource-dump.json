On the other, the technological, economic and political issues that have to be resolved before a concerted worldwide effort to reduce emissions can begin have gotten no simpler, particularly in the face of a global economic slowdown.",

   "abstract": "Presently, student, staff and faculty use of the standing buildings and infrastructure of the Rutgers campus complex at New Brunswick/Piscataway accounts for approximately 150,000 tons of carbon dioxide annually to the atmosphere each year. Factoring in commuting students, faculty, and staff, and the total emissions are increased to an estimated 300,000 tons of carbon dioxide each year.  One goal of the Rutgers Energy Institute is to work with students, faculty and staff across the campus complex to make the university carbon neutral by 2030.  The Rutgers Energy Institute (REI) is hosting its annual energy competition intended to engage students in devising creative and innovative solutions in reducing energy wasted at Rutgers.  \"Energy Innovation\" is the challenge for this 2011 competition.

   "abstract": "The last year has been a bad one for the corn ethanol industry. With relatively high grain prices and low oil prices, producers have struggled to stay profitable and many companies have gone bankrupt. In addition, growing consumer backlash has caused a public relations nightmare for the industry. With such a terrible state of affairs, where does the industry stand? In this podcast, we'll look at the state of first-generation ethanol in the U.S. Rick Kment, an analyst with DTN Research, describes how the industry may look differently when it comes out of the current period of stagnant growth and financial turmoil. Jeff Broin, CEO of the nation's largest ethanol producer, Poet, explains why the industry will actually deliver more fuel this year than last. He'll also tell us why he thinks the food versus fuel debate was overblown. Lester Brown, president of the Earth Policy Institute and author of Plan B 3.0, talks about why he doesn't believe ethanol producers are serious about next-generation fuels. He'll also explain why he thinks electric transport \u2014 not biofuels \u2014 are the future of transportation. Finally, Michael Pollan, author of the Omnivore's Dilemma, talks with Yale Environment 360's Kate Cheney Davidson about why our love of corn-based ethanol is a symptom of our larger problems related to food production and consumption.

With oil prices down, two thirds of American refineries sitting unused and no national target for the fuel, there are many questions about where the industry will go next. In this podcast, we'll look at what companies are doing to survive the market downturn. And as we'll find out, some companies are still thriving. Chris Langille of Batchelder Biodiesel shows us around the company's 300,000 gallon-per-year facility and talks about why relying on waste grease is a much better option than grain. Rick Kment of DTN Research talks about the difference between small biodiesel producers and large-scale ethanol producers, and how those differences have impacted the industry. Wall Street Journal Reporter Ann Davis discusses her latest article titled, \u201cU.S. Biofuel Boom Running on Empty,\u201d in which she writes about the financial problems that biodiesel and ethanol producers are facing.

In this podcast, we'll look at some of the technical, financial and cultural issues that can affect geothermal companies.Frank Monastero, President of Magma Energy Corp. and the Geothermal Resources Council, tells us about how Magma is expanding around the U.S., South America and to Iceland, despite the still-tight financial markets. That expansion has also brought a lot of challenges for Magma, including some resistance to the company's presence in Iceland.Alexander Richter, an analyst with Islandsbanki, describes why some Icelanders have raised concerns about a foreign company like Magma owning Icelandic energy assets.

But beyond the next few years, a large number of projects that utilize temperature extremes, both hot and cool, may come online. In this podcast, we'll look at two pioneer companies developing innovative, unconventional geothermal projects. Michael Hayter, Director of Geothermal Development for Raser Technologies, discusses the company's achievements and setbacks over the last two years as it develops a 10-MW plant in Utah that utilizes low-temperature brine for electricity. If successful, Raser may open the door for more \u201cbuild as you go\u201d geothermal power plants. Jared Potter, President and CEO of Potter Drilling, talks about the year of testing for the company's new \u201chydrothermal spallation\u201d drill, which could lower drilling costs by a factor of ten. This year, the heat was on, as the company had to achieve certain milestones in order to get more funding from Google. If Potter can achieve what its goals, the company may hold the key to the cost-effective development of high-temperature Enhanced Geothermal Systems.

After more than a decade of almost no activity in the U.S. geothermal sector, we're finally seeing a lot of new plants being developed. The problem is, many of them may not move forward because of a lack of transmission.But transmission is not the only issue. In this podcast, we'll look at how factors like resource evaluation, lack of government support and industry marketing have held back the industry \u2014 and how industry professionals are addressing these factors to make sure geothermal becomes a major piece of our global baseload power mix.Lisa Shevenell, a hydrologist with the Great Basin Center for Geothermal Energy, talks about why the industry is coming out of a dark age of almost no geothermal development. She'll also tell us about a new tool that makes it easier and less costly to examine potential resources.Alison Thompson, executive director of the Canadian Geothermal Energy Association, discusses the reasons why Canada has no geothermal power plants, despite having numerous public companies in the country. She'll also talk about the \u201cbrain drain\u201d of Canadian talent down to the U.S.Finally, Erik Swenson, a partner with the international law firm Fulbright and Jaworski, describes the need for a national transmission system for integrating more renewables.

In the past, people in the utility sector scoffed at the fridge solar industry, certain that it would never have a real impact on their business. People in the solar industry eyed the utilities with distrust, certain they were blocking progress in any way they could. Today, as utilities start to embrace solar \u2013 even developing their own projects \u2013 that relationship is changing for the better. In this podcast, we'll look at the increasing involvement of utilities in the solar space. There will certainly be more conflicts as the industry scales up, changing the way both parties do business. But it's becoming increasingly clear that utilities see solar as a necessary and lucrative investment option. We'll speak with Denis Dubois of Energy Priorities Magazine, who's been following how businesses are investing in solar under utility-developed projects. He'll give us the scoop on what kind of opportunities are available. We'll also discuss the evolving relationship between utilities and solar companies with Mike Taylor of the Solar Electric Power Association and Paul Alvarez of MetaVu Consulting. They'll tell us about the market drivers that are forcing utilities to change. Finally, Solar Marketing Consultant and RenewableEnergyWorld.com blogger Solar Fred, encourages solar companies to help start a new holiday in April: National Solar Quote Month.

President Hockfield has stated that MIT must begin to \u201cwalk the talk\u201d and set an example for other universities and communities across the country.  The Energy Club wants to get as much student involvement as possible in this initiative. The campus can only truly begin to cut back on its energy use when its students are aware and willing to work toward this goal.  In order to promote student involvement we are holding an undergraduate dorm electricity competition.  The contest will run from March 10th to May 4th.  Over that interval, the dorm that reduces its energy use per student the most will receive $10,000 in energy efficient retrofits.  This includes new lighting and showerheads. ",
