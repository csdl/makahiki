In this case, days where your lounge's energy usage went over your goal are colored in red. Looking at which days are in the red (over the goal) might help you to figure out what you can do to reduce energy usage. Also, if the days are going from red to all green, your lounge is improving, but if the red bars are getting bigger then you are doing worse over time.\r\n\r\nThe table on the right shows your lounge's real-time power usage, updated approximately every 15 seconds.

We compute two baselines, one for energy and one for power. \r\n\r\n<p>In the case of power, we monitor the average power use for each of the 24 hours in a day over the course of several weeks.  This results in 24 different baseline power levels for each residence hall (or floors in the hall).\r\nThis is good because power values in the middle of the night are typically much lower than in the middle of the day, so the baseline comparison takes that into account.\r\n\r\n<p>In the case of energy, we monitor consumption over the course of several weeks, and use this to determine the baseline as an average energy consumption per day.  This is good because energy consumption is shown as a cumulative value over longer periods of time, and so the baseline tends to even out short-term fluctuations in use. \r\n",

This data takes two forms:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li> Data collected from your interactions with this website.  We will collect data about the things you do while logged in to this website, such as your activities, goals, and commitments.  This helps us to understand which of these tasks are interesting and helpful.\r\n<li> Data gathered through interviews and questionnaires.  We will contact a subset of participants to request a short interview and/or to fill out an online questionnaire.  This data will help us to understand more about the strengths and weaknesses of our approach.\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h3>Privacy</h3>\r\nNo identifying information about you will be made available in any research publications resulting from this study.  \r\n<p>\r\nNote that as part of your participation in the competition, information such as your \"public commitments\" will be made available to others via mechanisms such as the Kukui Cup \"wall\" in your home page. If you choose to enable Facebook integration, then public commitments and activities will be transmitted to Facebook.  However, such identifying information will not be made available in future research publications.\r\n\r\n<h3>If you do not wish to participate</h3>\r\nYour participation in this study is voluntary.

   "text": "<h3>Individual and group competitions</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nThe Kukui Cup actually consists of two types of competitions: <emphasis>individual</emphasis> competitions and <emphasis>group</emphasis> competitions.  \r\n<p>\r\n\r\nIn an individual competition, you compete to accumulate the most \"Kukui Nut\" points by performing various actions, including activities, goals, and commitments.   To win in the individual competition, you simply have to accumulate the most Kukui Nut points.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn a group competition, pairs of floors compete as a unit.  Each dorm is divided into five groups consisting of floors 3-4, 5-6, 7-8, 9-10, and 11-12. To win in the group competition, your group must reduce its energy consumption more than other groups.  To simplify things, whenever we refer to \"floor\" in this competition, we really mean \"pair of floors\".\r\n\r\n<h3>Competition timeline and rounds</h3>\r\n\r\nThe competition will be held for three weeks starting in October, 2010.  The official start date will be announced soon. \r\n<p>\r\nTo provide multiple chances to win, the competition is divided into two week-long \"rounds\" as well as an overall \"grand prize\" round.\r\n<p> \r\nAfter the first week of competition, the winners of  \"Round 1\" will be announced based upon those individuals who accumulated the most Kukui Nut points and those floors who reduced their energy consumption the most. \r\n<p>\r\nAfter the second week of competition, the winners of \"Round 2\" will be announced.  Round 2 winners are based only on data from the second week of the competition.  \r\n<p>\r\nAfter the third week of competition, the \"Grand Prize\" winners will be announced.  The Grand Prize winners are based upon all three weeks of data. \r\n\r\n<h3>How to win!</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nTo compete for individual prizes, you first have to login to this website using the link at the upper right corner.  Only members of the dorms competing in this competition are able to login.  \r\n<p>\r\nOnce you have logged in, you can collect points by (a) performing activities, (b) making public commitments, or (c) participating in floor-level goals.\r\n<p>\r\nThe competition provides a wide variety of activities that you can participate in, such as watching videos, reading articles, attending workshops, or movies, or other events.  Each time you complete an activity, you submit it for points.  As part of this process, there is a simple verification procedure. For example, in the case of an activity that involves watching a certain YouTube video, the verification procedure might involve you answering a simple question about the contents of the video.  In the case of an event, you will find a Kukui Cup administrator at the event who can give you a personalized code that verifies your attendance. Each activity earns you from 5 to 20 points.  \r\n<p>\r\nAnother way to earn points is by making public commitments, such as \"I will turn off the lights after leaving a room\".  Each commitment lasts for five days, and you are limited to five commitments at any one time.  We do not verify your commitments, and each commitment (when completed after the five days) is worth 2 points.  Making a commitment is \"public\" in that it shows up on your Kukui Cup \"wall\" and on the electronic billboard associated with this competition. \r\n<p>\r\nA final way to earn points is through goal setting.  Goals are different from activities and commitments in that they always involve the entire floor. For example, one goal might be to reduce the floor's energy consumption by 5% over five days. When a goal is achieved, every member of the floor gets Kukui Nut points. Goals are worth between 5 and 10 Kukui Cup points. \r\n<p>\r\n\r\nIn addition to prizes for the most points, the competition will also award prizes to the floor that reduces their energy consumption the most.  To do that, you simply have to learn how to conserve energy!  As that is the goal of the activities, commitments, and goals, we believe that you will naturally learn how to save energy as you take part in this competition. \r\n\r\n<h3>Award categories and prizes</h3>\r\n\r\nRound 1 Awards:\r\n\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tr><td>Category</td><td>Award</td>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Individual on each floor who gained the most points.</td>\r\n<td>$25 gift certif.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Floor that gained the most points (across all dorms).</td> \r\n<td>Ice cream party</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Floor that reduced energy use the most (across all dorms).</td>\r\n<td>Ice cream party</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nRound 2 Awards:\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tr><td>Category</td><td>Award</td>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Individual on each floor who gained the most points.</td>\r\n<td>$25 gift certif.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Floor that gained the most points (across all dorms).</td> \r\n<td>Ice cream party</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Floor that reduced energy use the most (across all dorms).</td>\r\n<td>Ice cream party</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nGrand Prize Awards:\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tr><td>Category</td><td>Award</td>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Individual per dorm with highest number of points.</td>\r\n<td>iPod touch</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Floor with highest number of points.</td> \r\n<td>Pizza party</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Floor that reduced energy use the most.</td>\r\n<td>Pizza party</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<h3>In the event of ties...</h3>\r\n\r\n<p> In the event that two or more individuals (or floors) are tied for the most points, then the timestamp associated with the final goal, commitment, or activity associated with the individuals (or floors) will be used to break the tie.  In other words, the individual (or floor) who got to their final point total first will be declared the winner. Under the remote possibility that the final timestamps are equal, a coin toss will be used to decide the winner.\r\n\r\n<p> Given that energy consumption is measured down to a fraction of a watt-hour, we do not anticipate that any floor could tie with respect to their consumption.  In case that this does occur, a coin toss will be used to decide the winner. \r\n\r\n",
