The inaugural Kukui Cup was held in Fall, 2011 for over 1,000 first year students living in the Hale Aloha residence halls at the University of Hawaii. We are planning the second Kukui Cup for Fall, 2012.  \n\n##Why is the Kukui Cup important to Hawaii?##\nOne of the great challenges facing Hawaii today is our dependence on foreign oil, which negatively affects our security, our economy, our environment, and our next generation's ability to have a healthy, prosperous, sustainable lifestyle. The Kukui Cup raises awareness about Hawaii's oil dependency and how to work toward a better energy future.  \n\nWe created the following three minute video to help explain why we believe energy issues are so important to Hawaii.    \n\n<center>\n<div class=\"video-container video-wrapper2 tabbed\">\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" style=\"max-width: 500px;\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/EJc0mXS7JCo\"\n                frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n</center>   \n\n##How it works##\nStudents participating in the Kukui Cup challenge can login to the website during the challenge to gain access about their current power consumption and cumulative energy use. The site also provides short videos developed specifically for the competition that provide insight into Hawaii energy issues, and students can earn points by correctly answering questions about each video's content. Other ways to earn points include meeting a daily energy conservation goal, attending short, interactive \"workshops\" about energy, or going on excursions to power plants, wind farms, and more. Participation can lead to prizes including t-shirts, pizza parties, and gift certificates. By playing the game, students become knowledgeable about the energy challenges facing Hawaii and how to change their own behavior and those around them to use energy more efficiently.  \n\nThe following two minute video was used in 2011 to introduce students to the Kukui Cup; it is one of the first things they watched after logging in to the website:  \n\n<center>\n<div class=\"video-container video-wrapper2\">\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" style=\"max-width: 500px;\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/T37kNTkZCrA\"\"\n                frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n</center>  \n\n##For more information##\nFor more information, please go to <a href=\"http://kukuicup.org\">kukuicup.org</a>.  \n  \n",
