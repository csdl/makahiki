For every distinct wasting situation you find, we'll award 5 Canopy Karma points, up to 50 points. We'll also pass your list on the the appropriate people to try to get the wasting stopped!"

For this activity, you will make a **video** on the subject of one of the categories from the Smart Grid such as energy, lighting, transportation and post it on YouTube. Note that this activity will require significantly more effort than normal activities, but it is also worth more points. This activity is worth a variable number of points, so the more effort and the higher quality of your video, the more points you will receive.\r\n\r\nMaking a interesting video can be hard work. You'll find it much easier if you write out a little \"screenplay\" beforehand and think about what you want to communicate. YouTube has a [Handbook](http://www.youtube.com/t/yt_handbook_produce) with lots of great tips on making videos. Points will be awarded based on your video's originality, quality, and impact. For example, you talking into your webcam will get fewer points than visualizing your points with images or outdoor video. Make sure you mention the Kukui Cup either in your video or in the description field. When your video is ready, you can submit the URL for verification and scoring.\r\n\r\n*When submitting a video created by a group of players, please let us know how many people are planning to submit the video for points so we can divide the credit.*"

The art should have some relationship to the theme of the Kukui Cup: use your imagination. To receive credit for this activity, take a picture of it (preferably at night) and include some text describing what your art is about. The more amazing, creative, and energy-related your window art, the more points you can earn. Since you still want to save energy, we recommend that you light up your art between 9-9:15 PM, you don't need to keep it lit all night long.\r\n\r\nAnother way to get more points for this activity is to enlist your neighbors beside you, above you, or below you to create a coordinated group window art effort. Take a photo of all of the windows, then tell us in the description which one is yours.\r\n\r\nThe more awesome your art, the closer to 50 points you'll earn.\r\n"
