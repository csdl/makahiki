<h3>Motivation</h3>
One of the goals of the Kukui Cup is to learn more about the factors which help people to make sustained, positive changes to their energy behaviors.
<h3>Kinds of data collected</h3>
In order to accomplish this goal, we wish to collect and analyze data about your participation in the competition.  This data takes three forms:
<ol>
<li> Data collected from your interactions with this website.  We will collect data about the things you do while logged in to this website, such as your activities, goals, and commitments.  This helps us to understand which of these tasks are interesting and helpful.
<li> Data gathered through interviews and questionnaires.  We will contact a subset of participants to request a short interview and/or to fill out an online questionnaire.  This data will help us to understand more about the strengths and weaknesses of our approach.
<li> Data gathered about the electricity use of your lounge (A-E, pairs of teams) in aggregate. This aggregate data on electricity does not provide us with any information on the electricity usage of individual rooms.
</ol>

<h3>Privacy</h3>
No identifying information about you will be made available in any research publications resulting from this study.  
<p>
Note that as part of your participation in the competition, information such as your "public commitments" will be made available to others via mechanisms such as the Kukui Cup "wall" in your home page. The website may offer you the opportunity to share your competition activities on Facebook. If you actively choose to share data with Facebook, then public commitments and activities will be transmitted to Facebook. However, we record no data from Facebook (such as your friend list).

<h3>If you do not wish to participate</h3>
Your participation in this study is voluntary. If you decide you do not wish to participate in this study at any time, please contact Philip Johnson (<a href="mailto:johnson@hawaii.edu">johnson@hawaii.edu</a>, 956-3489, POST 307, University of Hawaii). We will remove your data from all analyses.
<p>
You can decline to participate in this study but still participate in the Kukui Cup.   Your decision to participate or not has no impact on your ability to win prizes or participate in events associated with the competition. Simply continue to participate in the competition, and contact Prof. Johnson to have your information removed from the study data.
