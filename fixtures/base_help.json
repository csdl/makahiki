In the real world, participants attend events, engage in real-world activities like geocaching, scavenger hunts, and artistic/musical events, win prizes, and most importantly, modify their energy-related behaviors. In the virtual world of the Kukui Cup web application, participants earn points, achieve badges, increase their energy literacy through readings and videos, and use social networking mechanisms to engage with friends about the event. Our hope is that this combination of real and virtual activities complement and reinforce each other. The blending of real and virtual worlds has been explored in other \"serious games\" such as Urgent/Evoke.",

This helps us to understand which of these tasks are interesting and helpful.\r\n* Data gathered through interviews and questionnaires. We will contact a subset of participants to request a short interview and/or to fill out an online questionnaire. This data will help us to understand more about the strengths and weaknesses of our approach. \r\n\r\n# Privacy\r\n\r\nNo identifying information about you will be made available in any research publications resulting from this study.\r\n\r\nNote that as part of your participation in the competition, information such as your \"public commitments\" will be made available to others via mechanisms such as the Kukui Cup \"wall\" in your home page. If you choose to enable Facebook integration, then public commitments and activities will be transmitted to Facebook. However, such identifying information will not be made available in future research publications.\r\n\r\n# If you do not wish to participate\r\n\r\nYour participation in this study is voluntary. If you decide you do not wish to participate in this study at any time, please contact Philip Johnson (johnson@hawaii.edu, 956-3489, POST 307, University of Hawaii). We will remove your data from all analyses.\r\n\r\nYou can decline to participate in this study but still participate in the Kukui Cup.

Each round of the competition has a set of prizes that are awarded through the Raffle Game. You can allocate your raffle tickets to any of the prizes, as can all the other Kukui Cup players. At the end of the round, a winner is selected from the tickets allocated to that prize.\r\n\r\nSince allocating more tickets to a prize increases your odds of winning it, you can decide whether you want to focus on one particular prize, or spread your tickets over multiple prizes. You can shift your ticket allocations as much as you want until the deadline given at the bottom of the panel.\r\n\r\n**Don't forget to allocate your tickets, as they expire at the end of the round!**\r\n\r\nNote that raffle tickets are separate from points, you won't reduce your score by allocating raffle tickets. Good luck!",
