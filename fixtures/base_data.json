On an average day, 60 million square kilometers (23 million square miles) of tropical seas absorb an amount of solar radiation equal in heat content to about 250 billion barrels of oil. If less than one-tenth of one percent of this stored solar energy could be converted into electric power, it would supply more than 20 times the total amount of electricity consumed in the United States on any given day.

   "abstract": "Utilities and solar companies haven't historically had a very positive relationship. In the past, people in the utility sector scoffed at the fridge solar industry, certain that it would never have a real impact on their business. People in the solar industry eyed the utilities with distrust, certain they were blocking progress in any way they could. Today, as utilities start to embrace solar \u2013 even developing their own projects \u2013 that relationship is changing for the better. In this podcast, we'll look at the increasing involvement of utilities in the solar space. There will certainly be more conflicts as the industry scales up, changing the way both parties do business. But it's becoming increasingly clear that utilities see solar as a necessary and lucrative investment option. We'll speak with Denis Dubois of Energy Priorities Magazine, who's been following how businesses are investing in solar under utility-developed projects. He'll give us the scoop on what kind of opportunities are available. We'll also discuss the evolving relationship between utilities and solar companies with Mike Taylor of the Solar Electric Power Association and Paul Alvarez of MetaVu Consulting. They'll tell us about the market drivers that are forcing utilities to change. Finally, Solar Marketing Consultant and RenewableEnergyWorld.com blogger Solar Fred, encourages solar companies to help start a new holiday in April: National Solar Quote Month. He'll talk about the need for solar companies to be innovative in their marketing efforts in order to educate the public about the affordability of solar PV and solar thermal.

After more than a decade of almost no activity in the U.S. geothermal sector, we're finally seeing a lot of new plants being developed. The problem is, many of them may not move forward because of a lack of transmission.But transmission is not the only issue. In this podcast, we'll look at how factors like resource evaluation, lack of government support and industry marketing have held back the industry \u2014 and how industry professionals are addressing these factors to make sure geothermal becomes a major piece of our global baseload power mix.Lisa Shevenell, a hydrologist with the Great Basin Center for Geothermal Energy, talks about why the industry is coming out of a dark age of almost no geothermal development. She'll also tell us about a new tool that makes it easier and less costly to examine potential resources.Alison Thompson, executive director of the Canadian Geothermal Energy Association, discusses the reasons why Canada has no geothermal power plants, despite having numerous public companies in the country. She'll also talk about the \u201cbrain drain\u201d of Canadian talent down to the U.S.Finally, Erik Swenson, a partner with the international law firm Fulbright and Jaworski, describes the need for a national transmission system for integrating more renewables.

But beyond the next few years, a large number of projects that utilize temperature extremes, both hot and cool, may come online. In this podcast, we'll look at two pioneer companies developing innovative, unconventional geothermal projects. Michael Hayter, Director of Geothermal Development for Raser Technologies, discusses the company's achievements and setbacks over the last two years as it develops a 10-MW plant in Utah that utilizes low-temperature brine for electricity. If successful, Raser may open the door for more \u201cbuild as you go\u201d geothermal power plants. Jared Potter, President and CEO of Potter Drilling, talks about the year of testing for the company's new \u201chydrothermal spallation\u201d drill, which could lower drilling costs by a factor of ten. This year, the heat was on, as the company had to achieve certain milestones in order to get more funding from Google. If Potter can achieve what its goals, the company may hold the key to the cost-effective development of high-temperature Enhanced Geothermal Systems.

That expansion has also brought a lot of challenges for Magma, including some resistance to the company's presence in Iceland.Alexander Richter, an analyst with Islandsbanki, describes why some Icelanders have raised concerns about a foreign company like Magma owning Icelandic energy assets.

With relatively high grain prices and low oil prices, producers have struggled to stay profitable and many companies have gone bankrupt. In addition, growing consumer backlash has caused a public relations nightmare for the industry. With such a terrible state of affairs, where does the industry stand? In this podcast, we'll look at the state of first-generation ethanol in the U.S. Rick Kment, an analyst with DTN Research, describes how the industry may look differently when it comes out of the current period of stagnant growth and financial turmoil. Jeff Broin, CEO of the nation's largest ethanol producer, Poet, explains why the industry will actually deliver more fuel this year than last. He'll also tell us why he thinks the food versus fuel debate was overblown. Lester Brown, president of the Earth Policy Institute and author of Plan B 3.0, talks about why he doesn't believe ethanol producers are serious about next-generation fuels. He'll also explain why he thinks electric transport \u2014 not biofuels \u2014 are the future of transportation. Finally, Michael Pollan, author of the Omnivore's Dilemma, talks with Yale Environment 360's Kate Cheney Davidson about why our love of corn-based ethanol is a symptom of our larger problems related to food production and consumption.

   "abstract": "The Smart Grid is an intriguing but elusive concept. What exactly do we mean when we talk about the intelligent grid? And where does renewable energy fit into the mix? In this podcast, we'll explore the technological and conceptual basics of the evolving grid. Eric Lightner, Director of the Smart Grid Task Force at the U.S. Department of Energy, outlines the way the grid works today and how that may change with technological progress.Tim Healy, CEO of the intelligent demand response provider EnerNOC, shows us how the company remotely manages the energy use of commercial and industrial customers.And Richard Baxter, Senior Vice President of Ardour Capital Investments, talks about the thorny issues associated the management of data as the grid makes a digital shift.Inside Renewable Energy offers the latest in renewable energy news and information.",

To take control of our future, we need to understand the need for energy independence, and understand the way energy issues affect the well-being of our entire society. Perhaps if we look at energy independence as a security issue, we can better understand its urgency and take the necessary steps toward reform. ",

As the Legislature prepares for opening day, these discussion groups, both the House and Senate, and the Governor have or will be unveiling energy proposals.  Individually, these proposals may appear to be just small changes.  However, many fall into the desired actions of the Hawaii 10-point Energy Plan outlined below.  By talking and acting upon these measures in the framework of a 10-point plan, we can begin to understand how small changes can make big differences much like epidemics described in Malcolm Gladwell\u2019s, The Tipping Point.",
