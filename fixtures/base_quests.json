The video will help you to understand what the Kukui Cup is all about, and briefly introduce you to the things you can do to win.\r\n\r\nTo watch the video, click on the Get Nutz icon (looks like a old-school scoreboard) and then click on the first square in the Smart Grid Game (upper left corner). Watch the video, answer a question about it correctly, and you are on your way to Kukui Cup domination!"

      "description": "The Kukui Cup is all about energy: learning about it and conserving it. On this quest, you will learn some basic information about power and energy, which will give you a solid foundation for all the other energy-related activities in the game.\r\n\r\nYou must watch two videos (Power & Energy, and Energy Intuition) and answer a question about each in order to complete this quest. You can find the videos in the Smart Grid Game, which is located on the Get Nutz page.\r\n\r\nTo get to the Get Nutz page, click on the icon that looks like a old-school scoreboard in the navigation bar in the upper left corner of this page. The two videos are in the Basic Energy column of the Smart Grid Game.\r\n\r\nAfter you click on the square for a video, you will see the video embedded in the web page. Click on the video to play it. Pay attention while the video plays, as you have to answer a question about the video to get your points. Once you have watched the video, click the \"I Did This\" button. Enter your answer to the question, and press Submit. If you don't know the answer, close the dialog box and try watching the video again.\r\n\r\nA Kukui Cup Admin will review your answer (usually in a few hours) and if you answered correctly, you will be awarded 10 points for each video."

This quest is about getting the word out about the Kukui Cup to all your friends on Facebook. If you don't have a Facebook account, then this quest is not for you (or maybe this is a reason to start using Facebook!)\r\n\r\nTo complete this quest, you will have to complete two activities: Like Kukui Cup on Facebook, and Share Kukui Cup link on Facebook. You can find both of these in the Smart Grid Game on the Get Nutz page.\r\n\r\nTo get to the Get Nutz page, click on the icon that looks like a old-school scoreboard in the navigation bar in the upper left corner of this page. The two Facebook activities are in the Get Started column of the Smart Grid Game.\r\n\r\nClick on the grid square for the activities (you may have to hunt around to find them). Each one will explain what you have to do to complete the activity. To demonstrate that you have completed the activity, you will need to take a screenshot of the Facebook page, and then upload that for verification.\r\n\r\nA Kukui Cup Admin will review your screenshots (usually in a few hours), and you will be awarded 5 points for each one."
