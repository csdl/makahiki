Commitments range from little things, like wearing a Kukui Cup button to promote the competition, to big things, like not eating meat. Each commitment lasts for 2 days, during which you agree to live up to the commitment. Once the 2 days are over, you come back to the site to collect your points.\r\n\r\nMaking a commitment earns you 2 points, and when you come back 2 days later to certify that you lived up to your commitment, you get another 5 points. To keep you focused, you can only commit to 5 things at a time.\r\n\r\n**To complete this quest:**\r\n\r\n1. If you aren't already on the Get Nutz page, click on the Get Nutz icon ![scoreboard icon](/site_media/static/css/default/images/icon-scoreboard.png) in the navigation bar at the top right of every page\r\n2. Click on a commitment square (the dark brown squares are commitments)\r\n3. Read about the commitment you are being asked to make\r\n4.
